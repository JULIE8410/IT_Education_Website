# IT_Education_Website
    1. The subject of the project : A homepage which offers IT education.
        Providing a couple of IT education is on my bucket list.
        So I tried to make what I have in my mind.
        There are total four pages in the project
        and three colors used in the project. (White, Black, Salmon)
        Most pages have responsive design.

            - I made Main page simple by showing a logo, images, and a welcome message.
            - HTML feature : Divide area for Header, Body, Footer
                             Inside header part, I added navigation horizontally.
            - CSS feature : responsive image size based on a window.
            - Javascript feature : To make the page impressive,
                 I added a couple of javascript functions.
             (changing images and showing letters one by one)

      (2) About page   
            - This page shows who I am, what I'm doing.

                             Using the link(It is displayed Click me!),

                            Use hover with box-shadow

            - Javascript feature : In this page, to catch users' interest, I added javascript functions.
              (showing greeting message based on time, a twinkling bulb, 
               making letters larger or smaller) And using the link(It is displayed Click me!), 
               users' can move the courses page so that they can search courses.

      (3) Courses page   
            - This page shows which courses I'm going to teach.
            - There are 6 courses(2 for UI/UX, 2 for Java, 2 for DB)
            - HTML feature : use div tag, course related images, a tag
                             Each course has a button that is connected apply page.
            - CSS feature : display inline-block, make buttons look better with hover,
                            For users' understanding, make things like labels to check 
                            level of each course(beginner, intermediate, advanced) easily
            - Javascript feature : There are 4 buttons(All/UIUX/JAVA/DB) to search selected course.
                                     I added button click function for each button.
                 e.g. when a user click the JAVA button, it will show 2 java courses.
